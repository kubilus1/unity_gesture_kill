# unity_gesture_kill
Kill multitouch gestures in Unity

Tired of the awful multi-touch gestures in Ubuntu.  Kill them with
unity_gesture_kill.


Build & Install
===============

For now, simply do a
  
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

Cleanup with
  
  $ make clean

Later perhaps I will upload pre-built packages.
